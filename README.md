# R1R2R3_data_codes
Data and python codes for "Locating the largest event observed on Mars with multi-orbit surface waves"

Python codes for reading and processing data and generating figures 1--3 are included as `figure1.py`, `figure2_mod.py` and `figure3.py`, respectively.

The data subdirectory contains the raw and deglitched data in miniseed format (see [IRIS website](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/miniseed/)  for more details) with instrument response removed and rotated into ZNE components, as well as a csv file with summary information on the locations using the different surface wave picking methods.
